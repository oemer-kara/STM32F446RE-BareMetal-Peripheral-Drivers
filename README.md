# STM32F446RE-BareMetal-Peripheral-Drivers
 This repository contains content for bare-metal firmware development on the STM32F446RE board. Learn to write firmware in embedded C, develop drivers for ADC, PWM, UART, TIMER, SPI, I2C, and DMA, use the ARM-Cortex CMSIS standard, and effectively debug and manipulate registers. No third-party libraries used.
